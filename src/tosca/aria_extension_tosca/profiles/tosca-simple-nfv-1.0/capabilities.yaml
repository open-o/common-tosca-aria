    description: >-
      Enhance compute architecture capability that needs to be typically use for performance sensitive NFV workloads.
    derived_from: tosca.capabilities.Container
    properties:
      mem_page_size:
        description: >-
          Describe page size of the VM:
  
          * small page size is typically 4KB
          * large page size is typically 2MB
          * any page size maps to system default
          * custom MB value: sets TLB size to this specific value
        type: string
        #constraints: # seems wrong in the spec
        #  - [ normal, huge ]
      cpu_allocation:
        description: >-
          Describes CPU allocation requirements like dedicated CPUs (cpu pinning), socket count, thread count, etc.
        type: tosca.datatypes.compute.Container.Architecture.CPUAllocation
        required: false
      numa_node_count:
        description: >-
          Specifies the symmetric count of NUMA nodes to expose to the VM. vCPU and Memory equally split across this number of

          NOTE: the map of numa_nodes should not be specified.
        type: integer
        required: false 
      numa_nodes:
        description: >-
          Asymmetric allocation of vCPU and Memory across the specific NUMA nodes (CPU sockets and memory banks).
  
          NOTE: symmetric numa_node_count should not be specified.
        type: map
        entry_schema: tosca.datatypes.compute.Container.Architecture.NUMA
